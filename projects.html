          <h3>Soup Kitchen</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I traveled to Sunset Park, Brooklyn to a Roman
            Catholic church. At this volunteer event, I helped package and serve
            food to the less fortunate during the harsh winter season. I was
            fortunate enough to speak to and get to know lots of new and
            interesting people who had great stories to share. Through this
            project I also did some community building with my fellow
            volunteers. We carpooled together, got to the church early to set
            up, finished handing out the food and then cleaned up as a group.
            This was one of my favorite volunteer experiences to date.

          <h3>Horseback Riding</h3>
          <p>
            Horseback riding is an amazing experience that I would recommend to
            anyone. This is a skill that takes time to perfect but it's
            definitely worth every minute. Being from a big city, it means a lot
            to be able to unwind and connect with nature every so often. The
            best way for me to do this is with natures big dogs, horses! I've
            been taking these riding lessons in Pensylvania for about a year and
            a half and every day I learn more. Through this riding program, I've
            learned horse anatomy, behavior, diet, and the history of horse
            riding. I am now a competetive rider in a small league and hope to
            be in a Grand Prix one day.

          <h3>Microsoft Excel and Python Crash Course</h3>
          <p>
            In this python and microsoft excel crash course, I learned all
            things excel and python. I developed codes and a variety of charts
            and graphs to make fully functioning programs and spreadsheets.Using
            Python, I created a many working codes including an automatic
            question-answering bot. This was a project that took a few weeks but
            it was incredibly fun. I hope to use these skills at a future
            internship or job that I am eagerly looking forward to.
